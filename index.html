                    <p>It is the collection of used materials, then converting them into raw materials, and then
                        reproducing them to
                        become consumable materials again, and the concept of recycling can include anything old that
                        can be used
                        again,in other words, it is a process through which invalid materials are taken advantage of.
                        Which is

                        and employing them according to the need for each piece in sculpting the statue or in making a
                        piece of art
                        and sticking the pieces next to each other by oxygen welding or copper welding, and the concept

                    <p>Reuse is the process of taking old things you might be thinking of getting rid of and finding a
                        new use for
                        them.
                        Shape: does not change the original shape of the product <br> Recycling is the process of
                        collecting and
                        processing materials that would otherwise be disposed of as garbage and converting them into new
                        products
                        where recycling can benefit society and the environment.
                        Shape: A new product is created so the look of the product is changed</p>
